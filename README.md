# Tower of Hanoi
This visualization has been done for the DSC106: Intro to Data Visualization course at UCSD.
It consists of an automated solution for the Tower of Hanoi puzzle implemented using d3. The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to one of the other rods, obeying the following rules:

1. Only one disk may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
3. No disk may be placed on top of a disk that is smaller than it.
